SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module with cmdlets to create partial- or full HTML output
    with table(s) of data from data in a PowerShell session, and that provides
    some additional functionality and features beyond the wonderful
    ConvertTo-Html cmdlet.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module provides cmdlets for creating HTML to represent in table
    format the given data from a PowerShell session.  While it does leverage
    ConvertTo-Html for the some of the final output, the module provides
    additional functionality by allowing for "highlighting" of desired rows,
    and for handling number formatting in the form of rounding, so as to
    remove the bit of additional work anytime a user wants to round values for
    eventual output.

    The module leverages the jQuery framework and the TableSorter jQuery plugin
    for making consistent, usable table layouts for your data.  The module
    expects that these JavaScript files are hosted centrally (anywhere
    accessible via the resulting HTML code), which allows for the generated
    HTML output to simply link to the JavaScript libraries, instead of needing
    to embed the JavaScript code into each output file.

  CONFIGURATION
      The module supports configuration through a pair of cmdlets and by using
      JSON-data file for persisting configuration values.  The default
      configuration is loaded into the current PowerShell session at the first
      module import time.  Two configuration scopes exist:  AllUsers and
      Session.

      The Session scope is the scope from the module's main cmdlets get their
      configuration values.  The very first use of the newly obtained module
      has both the Session and AllUsers scopes with the same values.  Changing
      a Session-scoped configuration value sets that desired value for the
      duration of the PowerShell session, only.

      The AllUsers scope is the scope that persists across PowerShell
      sessions. When the consumer sets a configuration value in the AllUsers
      scope, this updated AllUsers configuration is written to the JSON file
      in the module's filesystem directory.  This expects that the consumer
      has Write rights to said directory.  Changing a configuration item in
      the AllUsers scope will not affect the configuration for the current
      PowerShell session.

      To update the configuration values both in the current PowerShell
      session and for all subsequent PowerShell sessions, one should specify
      both the Session and AllUsers scopes when using the
      Set-NewHtmlReportConfiguration cmdlet.

      The consumer of this module can either leverage the default content
      delivery network (CDN) locations of the JavaScript/CSS files, or can
      choose to host the pertinent resource files on their web server in the
      appropriate locations (the locations that they specified in the module
      configuration).

  USE CASES
      The cmdlets in this module are useful for creating HTML for either full
      web pages, or for creating the table HTML for use in some other HTML
      document.  The full web pages are complete with code that will include
      the JavaScript libraries and CSS style files from the configured web
      server.  The table HTML is ready to be added to the body of such an HTML
      document, but does not include the code to refer to these library- and
      style files.  This is useful for when you want to build more than one
      table to include in your full HTML page.

      These cmdlets make it easy to round numeric values of properties with
      just the flick of a switch parameter.  By using this switch parameter,
      the cmdlet will round any numeric values to the specified number of
      decimal places.  This makes it oh so easy to tidy up the values where you
      don't need, say, thirteen decimal places of precision, and without
      needing to add any numeric formatting handling to your PowerShell before
      sending the objects to the NewHtmlReport module's cmdlets.

      An additional feature is the ability to "highlight" desired rows of
      data.  Say, a row whose object has a property that exceeds a certain
      value threshold (like, a datastore whose used capacity is over some given
      percentage), or that has a property that is not a standard, desired value
      (like, a VMHost whose connection status is something other than,
      "Connected").  This is handled by adding a particular property to any
      input object whose row you wish to hightlight in this way.  See the
      examples in the cmdlets' help for illustrations of how to utilize this
      feature.

EXAMPLES
  All of the cmdlets have help and examples built in.  For help on a specific
  cmdlet, use the normal route of "Get-Help -Full New-<someCmdlet>".
