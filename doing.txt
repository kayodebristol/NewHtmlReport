[feat_AddPipelineSupport]
done:
- added support for accepting objects from pipeline in `New-HtmlReport` function
- changed scope of 'static' config items -- by moving from `ScriptsToProcess` to `NestedModules` in .psd1; verified -- `NestedModules` is available in PowerShell v2

[feat_AddCfgCmdlet]
- add ability to manage module configuration via cmdlet in module, instead of requiring user to manually edit configuration file in module directory
  - by leveraging JSON-based configs file, and new `Get-HtmlReportConfiguration` and `Set-HtmlReportConfiguration` cmdlets?
  - allow for scope of setting:  Session, AllUsers
  	- if not already loaded at module import time (say, from previous module import), reads from disk; else, does not disturb the config that is already defined in the session
  	- need to store (in var) and return both AllUsers and Session scopes' configuration via Get-NewHtmlReportConfiguration
  	- expected behavior
  		- invoke Get-Cfg at module load, creating module-private variable
		- Get-Cfg:
  			- stores those in module-private variable
  			- if said variable not defined:  AllUsers and Session are the same, are read from json, and variable is defined, and they are returned (two objects)
  			- else, return said variable
  		- Set-Cfg:
  			- set values in proper scope
  			- if scope is AllUsers, export to json
  		- cmdlets in module use private-variable's Session cfg
  - need to consider how to not change this at module upgrade time (make settings sticky across module upgrades, make settings exportable?)
  - then, update cmdlets in module to use the Session-scoped config settings for places where config items are leveraged (replace use of `$hshConfigItems`)
  - if any still exist, remove the global $str* variables currently in use by module (put them into the module-wide configuration store)
  - need to eventually have something that will reset config values to "default" values (as kept in separate, "default" configs .json file?)
  - will .js and .css from CDNs work for all for datatables.net?  Like, imgs and whatnot? Or, need .css overrides for PNGs for when default CDN .css is in use?


RIGHT NOW:  finish clean up of old $hsh and old $str* items in C:\temp\GitThings\NewHtmlReport\NewHtmlReport\NewHtmlReport_configItems.ps1
