[feat_AddPipelineSupport]
done:
- added support for accepting objects from pipeline in New-HtmlReport function
- changed scope of config items (like `$hshConfigItems_NewHtmlReport`) -- by moving from `ScriptsToProcess` to `NestedModules` in .psd1; verified -- `NestedModules` is available in PowerShell v2
